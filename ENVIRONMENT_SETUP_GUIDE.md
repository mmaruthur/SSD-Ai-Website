## üîë Environment Variables Explained

### 1. Sanity CMS (Content Management System)

**What it does:** Sanity is where you'll manage all your website content (like blog posts, doctor profiles, services, etc.) - similar to WordPress admin but more modern.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

**How to get these values:**

1. Go to https://www.sanity.io/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project called "Southern Skies Dermatology"
4. After creating the project:
   - **Project ID** will be shown on your dashboard (looks like: `abc123xyz`)
   - **Dataset** - keep as "production" (default)
   - **API Token** - Go to "API" section ‚Üí "Tokens" ‚Üí Create a new token with "Editor" permissions

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not set up yet** - You'll need to create a Sanity account

### 2. Google Maps API

**What it does:** This allows the website to show interactive maps for each of your office locations.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key
```

**How to get this:**

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new project called "SSD Website"
4. Enable these APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
5. Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "API Key"
6. Copy the API key

**Cost:** Free for up to 28,000 map loads per month (plenty for a medical website)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not set up yet** - You'll need to create a Google Cloud account

---

### 3. Email Settings (for Contact Forms)

**What it does:** When someone fills out a contact form on your website, this sends you an email notification.

```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
CONTACT_EMAIL=info@southernskiesdermatology.com
```

**How to get SendGrid API Key:**

1. Go to https://sendgrid.com/
2. Sign up for free account (100 emails/day free)
3. Verify your email address
4. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "API Keys" ‚Üí "Create API Key"
5. Give it "Full Access" permissions
6. Copy the API key (you'll only see it once!)

**Alternative Options:**
- Use your existing email service (Gmail, Office 365)
- Use Formspree (easier setup, no coding needed)
- Use Resend (modern alternative to SendGrid)

**CONTACT_EMAIL:** Change this to your actual email address where you want to receive contact form submissions.

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not set up yet** - Choose an email service

---

### 4. Google Analytics (Optional)

**What it does:** Tracks how many people visit your website, which pages they view, etc.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

**How to get this:**

1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new property for "southernskiesdermatology.com"
4. Get your Measurement ID (starts with "G-")

**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è **Optional** - Can add later

## ‚úÖ Current Status of Your .env.local File

Your current file has placeholder values:

```
# Sanity CMS
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id          ‚ùå Needs to be replaced
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production                  ‚úÖ This is fine

CONTACT_EMAIL=info@southernskiesdermatology.com        ‚ö†Ô∏è  Update if different

# Analytics (optional)

```

## üìã Priority Order (What to Set Up First)

### **Immediate (to see the website work):**
None! The website works without these. They're only needed when you want to:
- Add real content (Sanity)
- Show maps (Google Maps)
- Receive contact form emails (SendGrid)

### **Short Term (within a few weeks):**
1. **Sanity CMS** - To manage content easily
2. **Google Maps** - To show office locations

### **Later (when going live):**
3. **SendGrid/Email** - For contact forms
4. **Google Analytics** - To track visitors

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (For Development)

**For now, you can continue developing WITHOUT setting these up!**

The website will work fine for:
- Design and layout
- Creating pages
- Testing features
- Building components

You only need these when you want to:
- Add real dynamic content
- Show location maps
- Make contact forms send emails
- Track website visitors

---

## üîí Security Notes

1. **Never share your .env.local file** - It contains secret keys
2. **Don't commit it to Git** - It's already in `.gitignore`
3. **Use different keys for development vs production** - When you deploy live, use separate API keys
4. **Keep backups** - Save your keys somewhere safe (password manager)

---

## ‚ùì Questions?

**Q: What if I don't set these up right away?**
A: That's fine! The website will work, you just won't have maps, dynamic content, or email forms yet.

**Q: Are these services free?**
A: Yes, all have free tiers that are plenty for a medical practice website:
- Sanity: Free for 3 users, unlimited API requests
- Google Maps: Free up to 28,000 loads/month
- SendGrid: Free for 100 emails/day
- Google Analytics: Completely free

**Q: Can I change these later?**
A: Yes! You can update the `.env.local` file anytime. Just restart the development server after changes.

## üìû Next Steps

1. **For now**: Leave the file as-is and continue development
2. **This week**: Set up Sanity CMS (30 minutes)
3. **Next week**: Set up Google Maps (20 minutes)
4. **Before launch**: Set up email service (15 minutes)

The website is already working at http://localhost:3000 - these are just for added features!
