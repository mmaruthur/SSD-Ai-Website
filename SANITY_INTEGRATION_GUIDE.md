## üöÄ How to Connect Sanity CMS

### Step 1: Create Your Sanity Account (5 minutes)

1. Go to **https://sanity.io**
2. Click **"Get started"** or **"Sign up"**
3. Sign up with:
   - GitHub (recommended - easiest)
   - OR Google
   - OR Email

### Step 2: Create a New Project

1. After signing in, click **"Create new project"**
2. **Project Name**: `Southern Skies Dermatology`
3. **Dataset**: `production` (leave as default)
4. **Region**: Choose closest to you (e.g., `US West` for Arizona)

### Step 3: Get Your Project ID

After creating the project:
1. You'll see a **Project ID** (looks like: `abc123xyz`)
2. **COPY THIS ID** - you'll need it!

### Step 4: Create an API Token

1. In your Sanity dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
2. Click **"Add API Token"**
3. **Token name**: `Website Editor`
4. **Permissions**: Select **Editor**
5. Click **"Add Token"**
6. **COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY** - you'll only see it once!

### Step 5: Update Environment Variables

Open `.env.local` and update these lines:

```env
# Replace with your actual values:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=abc123xyz    ‚Üê Your Project ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production      ‚Üê Keep as-is
SANITY_API_TOKEN=sk_abc123...              ‚Üê Your API Token
```

### Step 6: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 7: Import Your Content

```bash
node scripts/import-to-sanity.js
```

- View imported content

## üîÑ Updating Website to Use Sanity Data

After importing content, you'll need to update the pages to fetch from Sanity instead of using mock data. Here's what needs to change:

### Pages to Update:
1. `src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage (featured providers/services)
2. `src/app/providers/page.tsx` - Providers listing
3. `src/app/providers/[slug]/page.tsx` - Individual provider pages
4. `src/app/services/page.tsx` - Services listing
5. `src/app/locations/page.tsx` - Locations listing

### Example Change (Homepage):

**Before (Mock Data):**
```typescript
const featuredProviders = [
  { name: 'Dr. Malia Downing', ... },
  // hardcoded data
];
```

**After (Sanity Data):**
```typescript
import { getFeaturedProviders } from '@/lib/sanity.queries';

export default async function Home() {
  const featuredProviders = await getFeaturedProviders(3);
  // data from Sanity CMS
}
```
